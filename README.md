Still under development, but password page monitor is done already. Please enjoy yourself!

## Usage

- You are able to monitor "any" Shopify site.
- When password page is up or down, it will send you a notification to your discord/slack webhooks.
- Will give you exact timestamp. ~ 0-1 MS delay.
- Good proxies will give you better result.
- Just saying the monitor will spam your channel 10x because to remind you that the password page is up or down. But, you can choose to not let it spam you.
